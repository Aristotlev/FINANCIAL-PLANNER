// Inside your component
const [showUSModal, setShowUSModal] = useState(false);

// Add this button in your UI
<button
  onClick={() => setShowUSModal(true)}
  className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 text-white px-4 py-3 rounded-lg hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-purple-700 transition-all shadow-md hover:shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center gap-2"
>
  <span className="text-xl">🇺🇸</span>
  <span className="font-semibold">Add US Tax Profile</span>
</button>

// Add the modal
<USTaxProfileModal
  isOpen={showUSModal}
  onClose={() => setShowUSModal(false)}
  onSave={handleSaveUSTaxProfile}
/>

// Handler function
const handleSaveUSTaxProfile = (profile, calculation) => {
  console.log('Profile:', profile);
  console.log('Calculation:', calculation);
  
  // TODO: Save to your database
  // await supabase.from('us_tax_profiles').insert({
  //   user_id: user.id,
  //   state: profile.state,
  //   ...profile,
  //   federal_tax: calculation.federalIncomeTax,
  //   state_tax: calculation.stateIncomeTax,
  //   total_tax: calculation.totalTaxLiability
  // });
  
  setShowUSModal(false);
};
```
