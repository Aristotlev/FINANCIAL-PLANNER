# CORS Error Fix - CoinMarketCap API

## 🔴 Problem

Your application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to fetch cryptocurrency data:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?symbol=BTC' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### What Caused This?

1. **Browser Security**: Browsers block requests from your frontend (localhost:3000) to external APIs (pro-api.coinmarketcap.com) unless the external API explicitly allows it
2. **CoinMarketCap Restrictions**: CoinMarketCap API doesn't allow direct browser requests (no CORS headers)
3. **Direct API Calls**: Your `enhanced-market-service.ts` was calling CoinMarketCap directly from the browser

## ✅ Solution

**Route all API calls through your Next.js backend** instead of calling external APIs directly from the browser.

### Architecture Change

**Before (❌ CORS Error):**
```
Browser → CoinMarketCap API (BLOCKED!)
```

**After (✅ Works):**
```
Browser → Next.js API Route (/api/market-data) → CoinMarketCap API → Response
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `lib/enhanced-market-service.ts`**
   - Changed `fetchFromCoinMarketCap()` to call `/api/market-data` instead of direct CoinMarketCap API
   - Now uses: `/api/market-data?symbol=BTC&type=crypto&source=coinmarketcap`

### 2. **Enhanced `app/api/market-data/route.ts`**
   - Added `fetchFromCoinMarketCap()` function for server-side API calls
   - Added `source` parameter support to specify data provider
   - Properly handles CoinMarketCap API authentication server-side

### 3. **Updated `.env.local`**
   - Added `CMC_API_KEY` (server-side only, more secure)
   - Kept `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMC_API_KEY` for backward compatibility

## 🔑 Environment Variables

```bash
# Server-side only (RECOMMENDED - more secure)
CMC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Client-side accessible (for backward compatibility)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CMC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Note**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are embedded in the browser bundle. Use `CMC_API_KEY` (without prefix) for server-side only.

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **No CORS Issues**: Server-to-server communication bypasses CORS
2. **API Key Security**: API keys stay on the server, not exposed in browser
3. **Unified API Route**: Single endpoint handles all market data sources
4. **Better Caching**: Server-side caching reduces API calls
5. **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate simultaneous requests

## 🧪 Testing

After restarting your dev server, cryptocurrency data should load without CORS errors:

```bash
# Restart your development server
# The terminal should show successful API calls like:
✅ BTC: Fetched from CoinMarketCap - $67234.56
✅ ETH: Fetched from CoinMarketCap - $3456.78
```

## 📚 Related Files

- `lib/enhanced-market-service.ts` - Client-side service
- `app/api/market-data/route.ts` - Server-side API proxy
- `.env.local` - Environment variables

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Frontend Request**: Your React components call `enhancedMarketService.fetchCryptoPrice('BTC')`
2. **Service Layer**: `enhanced-market-service.ts` calls `/api/market-data?symbol=BTC&type=crypto`
3. **Next.js API**: `route.ts` receives the request and calls CoinMarketCap from the server
4. **External API**: CoinMarketCap responds (no CORS issue since it's server-to-server)
5. **Response Chain**: Data flows back: API → Next.js → Frontend → UI

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always restart your development server after changing `.env.local` files
- The same pattern applies to all external APIs that don't support CORS
- Never expose API keys in browser code (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables)

## 🎉 Result

No more CORS errors! Your cryptocurrency prices will load successfully.
