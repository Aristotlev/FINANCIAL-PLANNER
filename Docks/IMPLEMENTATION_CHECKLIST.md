## 💰 Your Bitcoin Sale Example

**What You Said:**
```
"sold my Bitcoin"
```

**What AI Will Now Respond:**
```
✅ Sold 34 BTC at $111,248.39!

💰 Proceeds: $3,782,445.26
🟢 Profit/Loss: +$1,582,445.34 (+71.93%)
📊 Entry Price: $64,705.88 → Exit Price: $111,248.39

🎯 Position fully closed!

💡 Remember to consider capital gains tax on your profit!

Which cash account should I deposit the $3,782,445.26 into?
• Revolut Cash Card
• Bank of America account  
• Revolut
• BKS Bank account
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Smart Amount Detection
- **"sold my Bitcoin"** → Sells your ENTIRE position (34 BTC)
- **"sell 5 shares"** → Sells exactly 5 shares
- **"sell half my AAPL"** → Sells 50% of holdings

### Auto Price Fetching
- **You specify**: "at $180" → Uses $180
- **You don't**: Uses current market price automatically

### Profit Calculation
```
Entry: $64,705.88 per BTC × 34 = $2,199,999.92
Exit:  $111,248.39 per BTC × 34 = $3,782,445.26
Profit: $3,782,445.26 - $2,199,999.92 = +$1,582,445.34
Gain:  +71.93%
```

### Reallocation Options
```
"and put it in savings"    → Auto-adds to savings
"and move to cash"         → Auto-adds to cash account
"and buy AAPL"            → Triggers stock purchase
```

## 📊 What Gets Updated

### Instant Changes
1. ✅ Your holdings database
2. ✅ Cash/savings accounts (if reallocating)
3. ✅ Portfolio dashboard
4. ✅ All financial cards
5. ✅ Total portfolio value

### Real-Time Events
```javascript
✅ stockDataChanged      → Stock cards refresh

✅ financialDataChanged  → Dashboard recalculates
```
