## 📊 Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. **User Input**
```
User: "Analyze BTC"
```

### 2. **AI Detection** (`lib/gemini-service.ts`)
The `detectMarketAnalysisRequest()` function recognizes this as a market analysis request:

```typescript
{
  type: "asset",
  symbols: ["BTC"]
}
```

### 3. **Market Data Fetch** (`lib/ai-market-data-service.ts`)
Calls `fetchAssetInsights("BTC")` which:

**Step 3a: Fetch Live Price** (`lib/enhanced-market-service.ts`)
- Contacts CoinGecko API
- Gets comprehensive Bitcoin data
- Caches result for 60 seconds

```javascript
✅ BTC: Fetched from CoinGecko - $63847.50
```

**Step 3b: Get Market Analysis**
- Analyzes Bitcoin's market position
- Checks if BTC is in top performers
- Generates insights

**Step 3c: Create TradingView Chart**
- Generates interactive chart URL
- Format: `https://www.tradingview.com/...BINANCE:BTCUSDT`

### 4. **Response Generation**
Creates comprehensive response with:

```typescript
{
  text: "📊 **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n\n💰 **Current Price**: $63,847.50...",
  charts: [{
    type: 'line',
    title: 'Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart',
    symbol: 'BTC',
    embedUrl: 'https://www.tradingview.com/...'
  }],
  data: {
    price: 63847.50,
    change24h: 2.15,
    volume: 28400000000,
    marketCap: "$1.25T"
  },
  sources: ['CoinGecko API', 'TradingView Charts', 'Market Analytics']
}
```

### 5. **Display in Chat** (`components/ui/ai-chat.tsx`)
Renders beautifully formatted response with:
