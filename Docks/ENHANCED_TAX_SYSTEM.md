## 🧮 How Tax Calculation Works

### Step 1: Income Aggregation
All income sources are categorized by tax treatment:
```
Total Income = Standard Income + Custom Income Sources
```

### Step 2: Tax Treatment Application
Each category is taxed according to its rules:

**Ordinary Income:**
```typescript
Tax = Progressive Brackets × (Salary + Business + Custom Ordinary)
```

**Capital Gains:**
```typescript
Short-Term CGT = Regular Rate × Short-Term Gains
Long-Term CGT = Preferential Rate × Long-Term Gains
```

**Dividends:**
```typescript
Dividend Tax = Dividend Rate × (Regular + Custom Dividends)
```

### Step 3: Deductions
```typescript
Taxable Income = Gross Income - Standard Deduction - Custom Deductions
```

### Step 4: Final Calculation
```typescript
Total Tax = Income Tax + Capital Gains Tax + Dividend Tax + Social Security + Corporate Tax (if applicable)
Net Income = Total Income - Total Tax
Effective Rate = (Total Tax / Total Income) × 100
```
