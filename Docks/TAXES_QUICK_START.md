## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics

**Total Income**

**Total Tax**
- Combined amount of all taxes
- Includes income tax, capital gains, social security, etc.

**Net Income**
- What you keep after all taxes
- Your actual take-home

**Effective Tax Rate**
- Percentage of income paid in taxes
- Total Tax ÷ Total Income × 100

### Tax Components

**Income Tax**
- Progressive tax brackets
- Higher income = higher marginal rate
- Deductions reduce taxable income

**Capital Gains Tax**
- Short-term: Same as income tax
- Long-term: Lower preferential rate
- Holding period matters!

**Social Security / Payroll Tax**
- Fixed percentage of wages
- Often has an income cap
- Both employee and employer portions

**Corporate Tax** (if applicable)
- Only for C Corps, Ltd, GmbH, etc.
- Separate from personal income tax
- Creates "double taxation" with dividends

## Tax Optimization Tips

### 1. Hold Investments Longer
- Short-term gains (< 1 year): Taxed at income rates (up to 37-45%)
- Long-term gains (≥ 1 year): Preferential rates (0-20%)
- **Tip:** Wait to sell until after 1 year holding period

### 2. Maximize Business Deductions
- Equipment and software
- Home office expenses
- Business travel
- Professional development
- Marketing and advertising
- **Tip:** Track all business expenses meticulously

### 3. Choose the Right Company Structure
- **Sole Proprietor**: Simple but self-employment tax
- **LLC**: Flexibility, pass-through taxation
- **S Corp**: Salary + distributions can save on SE tax
- **C Corp**: Double taxation but lower corporate rate
- **Tip:** Consult a tax pro when choosing

### 4. Consider Your Country
- **USA**: High income tax, moderate capital gains
- **UK**: Personal allowance, reasonable rates
- **Singapore**: Very low taxes, no capital gains tax
- **UAE**: No personal income tax
- **Germany/France**: Higher taxes, more social benefits
- **Tip:** Factor taxes into relocation decisions

### 5. Time Your Income
- Spread income across years to stay in lower brackets
- Defer income to next year if expecting lower rates
- Accelerate deductions into current year
- **Tip:** Plan quarterly to optimize timing

### 6. Use Retirement Accounts
- 401(k), IRA (USA)
- SIPP (UK)
