## 🧮 Quick Calculation Formula

```
Step 1: Add all income
Total Income = Standard + Custom Sources

Step 2: Categorize by treatment
Ordinary = Salary + Business + Custom Ordinary
Capital Gains = Short-term + Long-term + Custom CG
Dividends = Dividends + Custom Dividends

Step 3: Apply rates
Tax = (Ordinary × Bracket Rate) + 
      (Capital Gains × CG Rate) + 
      (Dividends × Dividend Rate) +
      Social Security

Step 4: Calculate net
Net Income = Total Income - Total Tax
Effective Rate = (Total Tax / Total Income) × 100
```
