## 🎯 New Features Implemented

### 1. Priority-Based Feed Loading
```typescript
Priority 1 (Immediate): Major sources like CoinDesk, MarketWatch, FXStreet
Priority 2 (Secondary): Quality sources fetched after 1.5s
Priority 3 (Background): Supplementary sources fetched after 5s
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ First content appears in <2 seconds
- 📊 Full coverage loads gradually
- 🔋 Reduces server load and API calls

### 2. Intelligent Engagement Scoring
Each article is scored based on:
- **Source Priority**: 20-60 points
- **Recency**: 0-30 points  
- **Headline Quality**: 0-50 points

**Result**: Users see the most important headlines first, not just chronological order.

### 3. Smart Caching System
- **Cache Duration**: 10 minutes per source
- **Auto-refresh**: Every 15 minutes (silent)
- **Manual Refresh**: Bypasses cache, fetches all sources
- **Cache Efficiency**: 70-80% hit rate target

### 4. Optimized API Calls
- **Staggered Fetching**: Prevents API overload
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-second max per feed
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed feeds don't block others
- **Parallel Processing**: Priority sources fetch simultaneously
