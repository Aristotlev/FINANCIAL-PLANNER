## üìä Understanding the Dashboard

### Monthly Income
- **Only includes recurring income**
- All frequencies converted to monthly
- Example: $500/week = $2,165/month (500 √ó 4.33)

### Yearly Income  
- Monthly Income √ó 12
- Good for tax planning
- Shows your gross annual income

### Total Sources
- All income sources (recurring + one-time)
- Helps you see income diversity
- More sources = more stable income

## üè¶ Bank Account Integration

### Why Connect Accounts?
1. **See where money goes** - Track which accounts grow
2. **Cash flow planning** - Know when accounts get funded
3. **Better budgeting** - Understand account purposes

### How It Works:
- Each income source links to ONE account
- You can have multiple incomes to the same account
- The account must exist in your Cash Accounts first

### Setting It Up:
1. Make sure your bank accounts are added in the "Accounts" tab
2. When adding income, select from the dropdown
3. The format shows: "Account Name - Bank Name"
