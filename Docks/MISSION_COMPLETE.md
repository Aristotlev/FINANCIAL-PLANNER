## Smart Features

### Context-Aware
```
User: "what's Bitcoin at?"
AI:   "$111,248.39"
User: "sell all mine"
AI:   [Remembers BTC from context, executes sale]
```

### Price Intelligence
```
"sell at $180"     → Uses $180
"sell my Bitcoin"  → Uses current market price
"sell AAPL"        → Fetches live price automatically
```

### Reallocation Logic
```
"sold TSLA and move to savings"
  ↓
1. Sells TSLA
2. Calculates proceeds
3. Adds to savings account
4. Confirms: "💸 Proceeds moved!"
```

---
