## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface IncomeSource {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  frequency: 'monthly' | 'weekly' | 'bi-weekly' | 'yearly' | 'one-time';
  category: 'salary' | 'side-hustle' | 'freelance' | 'passive' | 'bonus' | 'other';
  connectedAccount: string;
  isRecurring: boolean;
  nextPaymentDate?: string;
  notes?: string;
  color: string;
}
```

### Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Monthly equivalent calculation
const calculateMonthlyIncome = (income: IncomeSource) => {
  if (income.frequency === 'monthly') return income.amount;
  if (income.frequency === 'weekly') return income.amount * 4.33;
  if (income.frequency === 'bi-weekly') return income.amount * 2.17;
  if (income.frequency === 'yearly') return income.amount / 12;
  if (income.frequency === 'one-time') return 0;
  return 0;
};

// Total monthly income (recurring only)
const totalMonthlyIncome = incomeSources
  .filter(income => income.isRecurring)
  .reduce((sum, income) => sum + calculateMonthlyIncome(income), 0);

// Total yearly income
const totalYearlyIncome = totalMonthlyIncome * 12;
```

### Event System
✅ **Data Change Events** - `financialDataChanged` event
✅ **Component Sync** - All components stay in sync
✅ **Cross-component Updates** - Updates reflect everywhere

## 📊 Data Flow

### Adding Income
1. User clicks "Add Income Source"
2. Modal opens with form
3. User fills in details
4. Form submits → `addIncomeSource()`
5. Saves to Supabase/localStorage
6. Updates state
7. Fires `financialDataChanged` event
8. UI updates automatically

### Editing Income
1. User clicks edit icon
2. Modal opens with current data
3. User modifies fields
4. Form submits → `updateIncomeSource()`
5. Updates Supabase/localStorage
6. Updates state
7. UI refreshes

### Deleting Income
1. User clicks delete icon
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. `deleteIncomeSource()` called
5. Removes from database
6. Updates state
7. UI refreshes

## 🔒 Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
✅ Users can only see their own income
✅ Users can only edit their own income
✅ Users can only delete their own income
✅ Automatic user_id filtering

### Data Validation
✅ Required fields enforced
✅ Amount must be positive number
✅ Frequency must be valid option
✅ Category must be valid option
✅ Connected account must exist

## 🚀 Performance

### Optimizations
✅ **Database Indexes** - Fast queries by user_id, is_recurring, category
✅ **Efficient Calculations** - Only recalculates on state change
✅ **Lazy Loading** - Data loaded only when tab is opened
✅ **Event Batching** - Single event for multiple updates

## 📱 Integration

### With Cash Accounts
✅ **Dropdown Selection** - Shows all user's cash accounts
✅ **Account Reference** - Stores account ID
✅ **Display Integration** - Shows account name in income list

### With Existing Systems
✅ **SupabaseDataService** - Uses existing service pattern
✅ **Theme System** - Respects dark/light mode
✅ **Format Utilities** - Uses shared `formatNumber()`
✅ **Icon Library** - Uses Lucide icons consistently
