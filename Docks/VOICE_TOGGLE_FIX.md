# Voice Assistant Toggle Fix

## Problem
The voice assistant was making TTS API calls and speaking even when the voice toggle button was OFF. Users wanted a clear separation:
- **Voice OFF** = Text-only chat, no voice responses, no API calls
- **Voice ON** = Full voice features with TTS API calls and audio responses

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Voice Toggle Control** ✅
- Voice now starts **DISABLED by default** (safer, prevents unwanted costs)
- User must explicitly click the speaker button to enable voice
- Clear visual and chat feedback when toggling voice state

### 2. **Multiple Safety Checks Added** 🛡️

#### In `speakText()`:
```typescript
// 🚨 CRITICAL: Voice is OFF - no API calls, no speaking, return immediately
if (!voiceEnabled) {
  console.log('🔇 [SPEAK] Voice DISABLED - skipping all TTS (no API calls)');
  return;
}
```

#### In `speakWithElevenLabs()`:
```typescript
// 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK: Don't make TTS API call if voice is disabled
if (!voiceEnabled) {
  console.log('🔇 [ElevenLabs] Voice disabled - aborting TTS API call');
  return;
}
```

#### In `speakWithBrowserTTS()`:
```typescript
// 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK: Don't speak if voice is disabled
if (!voiceEnabled) {
  console.log('🔇 [BrowserTTS] Voice disabled - aborting browser TTS');
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Improved User Feedback** 📢

When toggling voice OFF:
```
🔇 Voice responses disabled. I'll continue to respond in text only.
```

When toggling voice ON:
```
🔊 Voice responses enabled. I'll now speak my responses using premium AI voice.
```

### 4. **Updated Welcome Message** 📝
Clarified how voice controls work:
- **Microphone button** 🎙️ - Speech-to-text input (independent of voice toggle)
- **Speaker button** 🔊 - Toggle voice responses ON/OFF
- **When OFF**: Text-only chat (no voice, no API calls)
- **When ON**: Premium AI voice responses (ElevenLabs + Gemini)

## Behavior

### Voice Toggle OFF (Default)
✅ Chat works normally with text responses  
✅ User can type or use microphone for input  
✅ AI responds in text only  
❌ No TTS API calls made  
❌ No voice output  
❌ No audio playback  

### Voice Toggle ON
✅ Chat works normally with text responses  
✅ User can type or use microphone for input  
✅ AI responds in text AND voice  
✅ TTS API calls made for responses  
✅ Premium AI voice (ElevenLabs/Replicate)  
✅ Audio playback of responses  

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/components/ui/ai-chat.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. Default `voiceEnabled` state changed from `true` to `false`
2. Added early return checks in all TTS functions
3. Enhanced `toggleVoice()` to show system messages
4. Updated welcome message to clarify voice controls
5. Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
