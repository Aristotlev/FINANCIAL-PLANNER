# 💡 Account Selection Feature - Quick Summary

## What Changed?

**Before**: When you sold crypto/stocks, proceeds automatically went to the first account.

**Now**: System **asks which account** you want the money transferred to.

---

## Example

### Old Behavior ❌
```
You: "sold my btc"

AI: ✅ Sold! Proceeds automatically moved to cash!
```
❌ Money went to first account without asking

---

### New Behavior ✅
```
You: "sold my btc"

AI: ✅ Sold 34 BTC at $110,882.84!
    💰 Proceeds: $3,770,016.70
    🟢 Profit: +$1,570,016.70 (+71.36%)
    
    💸 Which account should I transfer the proceeds to?
    
    • Revolut Cash Card (Cash) - Current: $5,000
    • Bank of America (Cash) - Current: $15,000
    • BKS Bank (Savings) - Current: $50,000

You: "Bank of America"

AI: ✅ Transferred $3,770,016.70 to Bank of America!
    💰 New balance: $3,785,016.70
```
✅ You choose where the money goes!

## Three Ways to Use

### 1. Let System Ask (Recommended)
```
"sold my Bitcoin"
→ System asks which account
→ You respond with account name
```

### 2. Specify Account Upfront
```
"sold my Bitcoin and transfer to Revolut"
→ Direct transfer, no question asked
```

### 3. Specify Category Only
```
"sold my Bitcoin and move to savings"
→ System asks which savings account
```
