## Smart Logic

### Amount Detection
```typescript
// "sold my Bitcoin" → sells ALL
if (!action.data.amount) {
  amountToSell = cryptoToSell.amount; // Use total holdings
}

// "sell 5 shares" → sells 5
if (action.data.shares) {
  sharesToSell = action.data.shares; // Use specified amount
}
```

### Price Detection
```typescript
// User specifies: "at $180"
sellPrice = action.data.sellPrice || 

// Or fetch current market price
(await enhancedMarketService.fetchAssetPrice(symbol))?.currentPrice ||

// Or use entry price as fallback
holding.entryPoint;
```

### Reallocation Logic
```typescript
if (action.data.reallocateTo === 'cash') {
  // Add proceeds to cash account
  await updateCashAccount(proceeds);
} else if (action.data.reallocateTo === 'savings') {
  // Add proceeds to savings
  await updateSavingsAccount(proceeds);
}
```
