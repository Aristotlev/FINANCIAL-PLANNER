## User Feedback Points

After testing, gather feedback on:

1. **Clarity**: Is the profit/loss display clear?
2. **Speed**: Does it feel instant?
3. **Confirmation**: Should we add "Are you sure?" for large sales?
4. **Details**: Is there too much/too little information?
5. **Reallocation**: Is the flow intuitive?

---

## Known Limitations (Current)

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è No transaction history view yet
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Tax calculation is just a reminder, not actual tax calc

---

## Next Steps After Testing

3. Add bulk selling (e.g., "sell all my tech stocks")
4. Create visual charts for profit tracking
5. Add export to CSV for tax filing
