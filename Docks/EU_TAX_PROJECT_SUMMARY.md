## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Immediate Use Cases

#### 1. **Calculate Individual Tax (Any EU Country)**
```typescript
import { calculateEUIndividualTax } from '@/lib/eu-tax-data';

const greekTax = calculateEUIndividualTax(
  'Greece',     // Country
  75000,        // Employment income
  10000,        // Capital gains
  5000          // Dividends
);

console.log(greekTax);
// {
//   incomeTax: 18840,          // Progressive PIT (9-44%)
//   socialSecurity: 8322,      // 13.87% employee SSC
//   capitalGainsTax: 1500,     // 15% CGT
//   dividendTax: 250,          // 5% dividend WHT (lowest in EU!)
//   totalTax: 28912,
//   effectiveRate: 38.5%,
//   netIncome: 46088
// }
```

#### 2. **Calculate Corporate Tax with Pillar Two**
```typescript
import { calculateEUCorporateTax } from '@/lib/eu-tax-data';

const germanCIT = calculateEUCorporateTax(
  'Germany',    // Country
  500000,       // Profit
  true          // Large group (Pillar Two applies)
);

console.log(germanCIT);
// {
//   corporateTax: 75000,       // 15% federal CIT
//   surcharges: 74625,         // Solidarity (5.5%) + Trade tax (~14%)
//   pillarTwoTopUp: 0,         // Already above 15% minimum
//   totalTax: 149625,
//   effectiveRate: 29.9%
// }
```

#### 3. **Compare Countries**
```typescript
import { calculateEUIndividualTax, getAllEUCountries } from '@/lib/eu-tax-data';

const income = 100000;
const comparison = getAllEUCountries().map(country => ({
  country,
  ...calculateEUIndividualTax(country, income, 0, 0)
}));

// Sort by effective rate (best to worst)
comparison.sort((a, b) => a.effectiveRate - b.effectiveRate);

console.log(comparison[0]); // Best tax jurisdiction for €100k income
// Greece: 32.1% effective rate
```

#### 4. **Get Country Tax Config**
```typescript
import { getEUTaxConfig } from '@/lib/eu-tax-data';

const spainTax = getEUTaxConfig('Spain');

console.log(spainTax.personalIncomeTax.topRate);  // 47%
console.log(spainTax.corporateIncomeTax.standardRate);  // 25%
console.log(spainTax.vat.standardRate);  // 21%
console.log(spainTax.socialSecurity.employee.rate);  // 6.35%
console.log(spainTax.withholdingTax.dividends.resident);  // 19%
```

### Integration with Existing Tax Card

**Easy 3-Step Integration:**

1. **Import EU tax functions** in `taxes-card.tsx`:
```typescript
import { 
  calculateEUIndividualTax, 
  getEUTaxConfig,
  getAllEUCountries 
} from '@/lib/eu-tax-data';
```

2. **Detect if country is EU** in tax calculation:
```typescript
const isEUCountry = getAllEUCountries().includes(activeProfile.country);

const calculation = isEUCountry
  ? calculateEUIndividualTax(
      activeProfile.country,
      activeProfile.salaryIncome,
      activeProfile.capitalGains.shortTerm + activeProfile.capitalGains.longTerm,
      activeProfile.dividends
    )
  : calculateTotalTax(/* existing calculator */);
```

3. **Enhance UI** with EU-specific sections:
```typescript
{isEUCountry && (
  <>
    {/* Social Security Section */}
    <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg p-4">
      <h5 className="font-semibold mb-2">Social Security Contributions</h5>
      <div className="text-sm">
        <div>Employee: {calculation.socialSecurity}€</div>
        <div>Rate: {euConfig.socialSecurity.employee.rate}%</div>
        {euConfig.socialSecurity.employee.cap && (
          <div>Annual Cap: {euConfig.socialSecurity.employee.cap}€</div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>

    {/* VAT Information */}
    <div className="bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 rounded-lg p-4">
      <h5 className="font-semibold mb-2">VAT</h5>
      <div className="text-sm">
        <div>Standard: {euConfig.vat.standardRate}%</div>
        <div>Reduced: {euConfig.vat.reducedRates.join(', ')}%</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </>
)}
```
