# 📸 Profile Picture Implementation - Complete Fix

## 🎯 What Was Done

I've implemented a comprehensive solution to display Google profile pictures for authenticated users.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Better Auth Configuration** (`lib/auth.ts`)
- Added explicit `scope` parameter to request profile information from Google
- Now requests: `["openid", "email", "profile"]` scopes

### 2. **Improved Auth Context** (`contexts/better-auth-context.tsx`)
- Added fallback checks for multiple possible image field names
- Fetches profile picture from API if not in session
- Enhanced logging to debug the full user object

### 3. **Created Profile Picture API Endpoint** (`app/api/auth/profile-picture/route.ts`)
- Queries the database for OAuth account data
- Fetches fresh profile data from Google API using access token
- Updates the user's image in the database
- Returns profile picture URL

### 4. **Created User Info API Endpoint** (`app/api/auth/user/route.ts`)
- Simple endpoint to fetch current user data
- Returns user info including profile picture

### 5. **Created Debug Test Page** (`app/test-auth/page.tsx`)
- Visual debug page to inspect all auth data
- Shows user context, API responses, and profile pictures
- Accessible at `/test-auth`

### 6. **Updated Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
- Added `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com` to CSP policy
- Allows Google profile pictures to load

### 7. **Enhanced Dashboard Display** (`components/dashboard.tsx`)
- Added proper error handling for image loading
- Graceful fallback to default avatar icon
- Added border and styling for profile pictures

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Check the Debug Page
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test-auth`
2. You'll see three sections showing:
   - User context data with avatar
   - Profile Picture API response
   - Session API response

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
Look for these logs:
```
✅ Session user data: { id: ..., email: ..., name: ..., image: ..., fullUser: {...} }
📸 Fetched profile picture from API: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...
```

### Step 3: Sign Out and Sign In Again
1. Sign out completely
2. Sign in with Google OAuth
3. Your profile picture should now appear in the top-right corner

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

If the profile picture still doesn't show:

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open DevTools Console and look for:
- `✅ Session user data:` - Check if `image` field has a value
- `📸 Fetched profile picture from API:` - Confirms API fetch succeeded

### 2. Visit Debug Page
Go to `/test-auth` and verify:
- Does the "User Context Data" section show an avatarUrl?
- Does the "Profile Picture API" section return an image URL?
- What does the full user object contain?

### 3. Check Database
The profile picture should be stored in the `users` table:
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, image FROM users WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

### 4. Verify Google OAuth Scopes
Make sure your Google OAuth consent screen includes:
- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`

### 5. Check Access Token
The profile picture API needs a valid Google access token. If expired, you may need to sign out and sign in again to refresh it.

## 🎨 How It Works

```
User signs in with Google
    ↓
Better Auth receives OAuth data (including profile picture)
    ↓
Profile picture stored in database (users.image)
    ↓
Session created with user data
    ↓
Auth context checks session for image
    ↓
If no image in session, fetches from /api/auth/profile-picture
    ↓
API queries database and/or Google API for fresh data
    ↓
Profile picture URL returned to frontend
    ↓
Dashboard displays image (or fallback icon)
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

### GET `/api/auth/profile-picture`
Fetches the user's profile picture from:
1. Database (users.image)
2. Google API (if access token available)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/..."
  },
  "source": "google-api" | "database"
}
```

### GET `/api/auth/user`
Returns current session user data

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "image": "..."
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **CSP Policy** - Updated to allow Google user content CDN  
✅ **Access Token Security** - Tokens are not exposed to frontend  
✅ **API Protection** - Endpoints require valid session  
✅ **Graceful Degradation** - Falls back to default icon if image fails  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Sign out and sign in again** to trigger a fresh OAuth flow
2. **Check the `/test-auth` page** to see all auth data
3. **Look for console logs** to verify data is being fetched
4. **Check your dashboard** - profile picture should appear top-right

## 💡 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Image not showing | Check console for `image` field in session data |
| 401 errors | Verify you're signed in with Google (not email/password) |
| Broken image icon | Image URL is invalid - check CSP policy |
| Still no image after sign in | Visit `/test-auth` to debug full auth flow |
| Image was working before | Clear browser cache and cookies, sign in again |
