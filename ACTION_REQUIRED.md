# I Cannot Automatically Fix This

I tried to guess the correct connection string, but all attempts failed. This usually means:
1. The **Project ID** (`ljatyfyeqiicskahmzmp`) might be wrong.
2. The **Password** might have changed.
3. The **Region** might not be `eu-west-2` (London).

## Please Help Me Fix It

1.  Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) -> Project Settings -> Database.
2.  Copy the **Node.js** connection string.
3.  **Paste it into the file `PASTE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE.txt`** that I just created in your workspace.
4.  **Save the file.**
5.  Tell me "I pasted it".

Then I will automatically update your configuration and verify everything.
